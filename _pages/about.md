Hello! Welcome to my ever-evolving website. I am currently a PhD Candidate in Hydrology at the University of Minnesota. I focus on using cool new mathematical and modeling tools to understand better the ways that ecosystems are responding to climate change. Right now I'm focused on bogs and forested watersheds but I am interested in all sorts of plants, animals, and environments. If you are interested in learning more about some of my ongoing projects hop on over to the 'projects' tab in the navigation bar. 

On the other end, I spend a lot of time thinking about how as scientists we can better communicate our work to curious audiences. The truth is that a lot of us are just kind of weirdos who love cool stuff and we want to share that with you! As an artist, I am particularly interested in how we can use comics and illustrations to communicate complex concepts. Often this also helps us better understand what we are doing as scientists. Some of my current art projects can be found on the 'portfolio' page. 

Finally, two disclaimers: (1) my views are my own and nothing on this page necessarily reflects the missions of the various organizations I have been a part of and (2) this space is in flux! I am constantly working to make it better and you can look forward to more content and maybe a sticker store (???) in the future. 

Happy learning, 
Mariel
