Peatlands, a subset of wetlands that store organic carbon in the form of peat, cover only 3% of the globe but are responsible for storing more than 30% of all soil carbon. They are one of the most efficient carbon stores on the planet and are a critical buffer against global warming. Many of these peatlands are found along two latitudes: right above the equator in areas like Florida, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia; and right below the Arctic Circle in Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia. My research focuses on the latter for another critical climate change reason: winter. A peatland's ability to maintain vast carbon stores is driven by its hydrology, specifically the water table. As winter temperatures and snowfall regimes change due to global warming, peatland hydrology shifts too, in ways that may decrease the carbon-trapping potential of these essential ecosystems. To figure out if and how peatlands are responding to these changes, we study the shifts in hydrologic connectivity under different snow regimes in peatland-dominated watersheds.

## Integrating Peatlands into Land Surface Models

Peatland hydrological processes are largely ill-represented in global land surface models. Many models, including the Community Land Model (CLM), overestimate the water table depth in peatland-dominated regions which could be affecting long term carbon dynamic predictions. One reason for this deficiency is that peatlands are spatially heterogeneous, and their distinct landscape units occur on a scale smaller than most model grids. Other peatland features such as surface microtopography and lateral flow across low gradient hillslopes are difficult to mimic in models but play large roles in dictating hydrologic flows. In this research we test the applicability of the new subgrid hillslope feature of CLM 5.0 to model the spatial heterogeneity of peatland watersheds and compare the results to existing representations of peatland hydrology in non-subgridded CLM using both statistical and hydrological performance metrics. Using 2-meter resolution LIDAR survey and assimilation of high spatial resolution field data, we demonstrate how the subgrid hillslope model can accurately represent the relationships between sensible features (e.g., climate, soil parameters), latent features (e.g., water table elevations, soil moisture) and functional processes (e.g., surface and subsurface lateral flows) in peatland systems. Results show that the inclusion of hillslope to CLM increases water table predictions significantly without specific surface microtopographical representation.

## Modelling Methane Emissions from Wetlands with Dichotomous Noise
The net production of carbon products (e.g., DOC, CO2, CH4) within peatlands is strongly controlled by hydrological dynamics and microbial composition. Because oxygen diffusion is greatly inhibited in water, water table depths define the vertical oxic-anoxic boundary within the peatland soil column that mediates different metabolic pathways. As a result of these hydro-biogeochemical interactions, carbon emissions from peatlands are affected by water table dynamics---the emission rates from fluctuating water table regimes will deviate from those resulting from stable hydrological conditions. To help elucidate the role of water table fluctuations in these biogeochemical reactions, we use a stochastic approach to model the random switching between inundated and aerated soil conditions. Although this model will not be able to capture spatially explicit advection or diffusion processes, the analytical treatment of our parsimonious model allows us to relate the total emissions in a given period to (1) the mean frequency of switching between aerated and inundated periods, (2) the kinetic order of decomposition reactions, and (3) the relative rates of production versus consumption. This stochastic approach will lay the groundwork for predicting the temporal variations in metabolic pathways---including their pulsing, lagged, or hysteretic dynamics---to hydrological dynamics in the future.
